                <h2>The Idea</h2>
                <p>In this project, I developed a compact, low-cost motion recognition system using the ESP32 microcontroller
                     paired with the MPU6050 inertial measurement unit (IMU). The goal was to create a system capable of detecting
                      and classifying basic directional movements—such as forward, backward, left, right, and stationary states—in
                       real-time. This project showcases my ability to design embedded systems for practical applications, with
                        a focus on precise movement tracking and efficient data processing.

                <h2>The Build</h2>
                <p>The system leverages the MPU6050’s accelerometer and gyroscope to capture raw motion data, which I processed using
                     sensor fusion techniques to derive meaningful directional insights. I programmed the ESP32 in C++ to handle
                      real-time data acquisition and implemented a lightweight algorithm to classify movements based on thresholds
                       and patterns. To validate the system’s accuracy, I conducted tests simulating various movement scenarios,
                        achieving reliable detection of intended motions with minimal latency.

                <h2>Implications</h2>
                <p>While this project centered on directional movement, its underlying principles—capturing and interpreting 
                    sensor data—have broader implications. For instance, similar systems could monitor dynamic behaviors in
                     real-world settings, such as tracking activity patterns to infer health or operational states. In a
                     <a href="Cow_Analysis_project.html" target="_blank">related project</a>
                     , I analyzed a dataset (I downloaded <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uihkjgfduyg7o8ga/animal-behaviour-accelometere-data" target="_blank">here</a>)
                      from a similar sensor mounted on a Livestock animal, exploring how motion data
                       could reveal behavioral trends. By applying statistical techniques in Python, I identified patterns
                        that hinted at well-being or stress, demonstrating how sensor-driven insights can inform decision-making
                         without diving into specifics like health diagnostics.

                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>This motion recognition system is a testament to my ability to build scalable, sensor-based solutions
                     for real-time applications. Its design prioritizes simplicity and adaptability, making it suitable
                      for environments where understanding movement is key—whether in robotics, IoT, or even indirectly
                       supporting systems that ensure optimal conditions for living beings. I’m excited to explore how
                        such technologies can contribute to innovative solutions in dynamic, real-world contexts.
