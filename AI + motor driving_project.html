                Diving into motor classification and anomaly detection project felt like stepping into a mechanical balance,
                 where every whir told its own story. At the heart of this orchestra was an <a href="https://www.nabto.com/guide-to-iot-esp-32/" target="_blank">ESP32</a>
                  paired with the <a href="https://www.pixelelectric.com/sensors/light-sound/sound-sensor/max9814-microphone-amplifier-module/" target="_blank">MAX9814 microphone</a>
                  —an acoustic detective that could pick up the faintest clues in motor sounds. My goal was to classify
                   motor states—full speed, half speed, and idle—and detect anomalies that could signal trouble cooking up beneath
                    the surface. Imagine a mechanic with superhuman hearing, equipped with AI instead of a wrench, capable of
                     recognising breakdowns before they even happen.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                The adventure began with collecting raw audio samples. Carefully capturing its full-speed roar,
                 its steady half-speed hum, and its gentle idle purr. With the MAX9814 microphone as my trusted
                  sidekick and its built-in auto-gain control ensured every nuance of sound was captured with clarity,
                   no matter the motor's volume. These weren’t just sounds—they were data, the golden nuggets I
                    needed to train my machine learning model.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                But, as with any great journey, challenges weren’t far behind.
                 Storing audio files in .wav format on an SD card turned into a technical maze, and debugging the
                  setup was like searching for a needle in a haystack while blindfolded. The smallest misstep could throw
                   everything off, but with patience and determination, I pieced it all together. Each milestone—getting
                    clean audio samples, ensuring proper file storage, and setting up the hardware—felt like a small victory.
            </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Then came the thrill of training the machine learning model. Using tools like
                     <a href="https://edgeimpulse.com/" target="_blank">Edge Impulse</a>, I transformed
                     those raw recordings into something far more powerful: a system that could classify motor states with
                      impressive accuracy and flag anomalies with precision. Those anomalies—tiny, often-overlooked indicators
                       of wear and tear—were like catching a plot twist in a mystery novel before it unraveled. Every flagged
                        anomaly felt like a win, knowing it could prevent costly repairs and extend the life of the motor.</p>

            <p style="text-indent: 30px;"> This project wasn’t just an engineering challenge—it was a delicate dance between hardware and software,
                 creativity and precision, theory and practice. It pushed me to think outside the box, adapt to the unexpected,
                  and appreciate the artistry of sound in a mechanical world. With each successful classification and every
                   anomaly detected, I wasn’t just listening to a motor—I was redefining what it means to truly hear machines.</p>
