            <h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
            <p>This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of animal health records to uncover patterns and insights related to diseases, symptoms, and demographic factors. The dataset includes information such as <b>animal type, age, temperature, symptoms,</b> and <b>diagnosed diseases.</b> There are different animals in the dataset but in this case I chose to work with cows simply because of my love for yogurts. To ensure a clear and manageable workflow, the project was divided into four distinct phases of analysis:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Disease Prevalence & Demographic Patterns</b></li>
                <li><b>Symptom-Disease Association Mapping</b></li>
                <li><b>Temperature Profiling by Disease</b></li>
                <li><b>Symptom Co-Occurrence Networks</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each phase was designed to address specific questions and provide actionable insights. By breaking the project into smaller, focused analyses, the workflow became simpler, and the results were easier to interpret and communicate.</p>

            <h3><b>1. <u>Disease Prevalence & Demographic Patterns</u></b></h3>
            <h4>Objective</h4>
            <p>The goal of this analysis was to identify the most common diseases in the dataset and explore their relationship with demographic factors such as age. This helps answer questions like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Which diseases are most common?</b></li>
                <li><b>Are certain diseases more common in specific age groups?</b></li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Clear summary of the disease patterns:</h4>

</figure>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Overall Disease Distribution:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The diseases are fairly evenly distributed in the population.</li>
                        <li>Blackleg and Anthrax are the most common, each affecting about 22% of cases.</li>
                        <li>Foot and mouth follows closely at 21.62%.</li>
                        <li>Pneumonia and lumpy virus have slightly lower prevalence at around 17% each.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Age Group Patterns:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The distribution is remarkably consistent across both age groups.</li>
                        <li>Young cows (1-2 years) show slightly higher rates of:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Anthrax (22.65%)</li>
                                <li>Foot and mouth (22.18%)</li>
                                <li>Lumpy virus (17.27%)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Adult cows (3-15 years) show marginally higher rates of:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Blackleg (22.24%)</li>
                                <li>Pneumonia (17.54%)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Insights</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>No disease shows strong age-specific preference (all ratios are close to 1.0).</li>
                <li>The balanced distribution suggests these diseases affect both age groups similarly.</li>
                <li>The slight variations in prevalence between age groups are not clinically significant.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>This even distribution pattern indicates that age might not be a primary factor in disease susceptibility for these particular conditions. This analysis revealed clear patterns in disease prevalence and their association with age. These insights can help prioritize disease prevention and treatment strategies for different age groups.</p>

                                <li>"Chest discomfort" - unique to this disease</li>
                                <li>"Swelling in neck" - specific indicator</li>
                                <li>"Swelling in extremities" - distinctive pattern</li>

            <h4>Key Observations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>These symptoms serve as reliable diagnostic markers.</li>
                <li>They appear consistently with their respective diseases.</li>

            <h3><b>3. <u>Temperature Profiling by Disease</u></b></h3>
            <h4>Objective</h4>
            <p>The goal of this analysis was to explore whether diseases are associated with abnormal body temperatures. Key questions included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Do certain diseases cause higher or lower body temperatures?</li>
                <li>Are there significant differences in temperature ranges across diseases?</li>

                        <li>Pneumonia: Strongest negative correlation (-0.021) - slight tendency for temperature to decrease with age.</li>
                        <li>Blackleg: Weak negative correlation (-0.017).</li>
                        <li>Foot and Mouth: Very weak negative correlation (-0.007).</li>

            <h4>Key Observations:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The correlations are consistently weak across all diseases.</li>
                <li>Temperature response appears to be disease-dependent rather than age-dependent.</li>
                <li>These findings suggest that fever patterns are primarily driven by the disease itself, not the age of the animal.</li>

            <h4><b>Key Insights/Observations</b></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Loss of appetite emerges as the most influential symptom, connecting strongly with 41 million co-occurrences across the network.</li>
                <li>The network reveals 24 unique symptoms forming 300 distinct connections, demonstrating rich diagnostic patterns.</li>
                <li>Depression and painless lumps consistently appear together, creating reliable symptom clusters for disease identification.</li>
                <li>Each symptom connects with an average of 25 others, showing robust relationships throughout the network.</li>
                <li>Movement-related symptoms like difficulty walking form significant secondary connections, completing the diagnostic framework.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>This network analysis successfully revealed robust symptom relationships in cattle diseases, highlighting clear diagnostic patterns. The identification of key symptom clusters, particularly around loss of appetite and depression, provides valuable insights for veterinary practice. The strong statistical foundation, with 300 distinct connections among 24 symptoms, establishes reliable diagnostic indicators. The clear hierarchy of symptom relationships offers practical guidance for disease identification. This comprehensive understanding of symptom co-occurrences enhances the precision and effectiveness of veterinary diagnostics.</p>

        <h2><b>Overall Conclusion</b></h2>
        <p>By dividing the project into four focused analyses, the workflow became more manageable, and the results were easier to interpret. Each phase provided unique insights into the dataset, from understanding disease prevalence and symptom patterns to exploring temperature trends and symptom co-occurrence networks. These insights can inform better decision-making in animal health management, such as <b>early disease detection</b> using embedded devices and data analysis (<a href="Cow_Analysis_project.html" target="_blank">I did a project on that here</a>), targeted treatment, and resource allocation.</p>
        <p>This structured approach not only simplified the analysis process but also ensured that each phase contributed meaningfully to the overall understanding of the dataset. The results are presented in a clear and actionable manner, making them suitable for both technical and non-technical audiences.</p>
