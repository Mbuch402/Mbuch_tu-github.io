            <H3>Hey everyone, let’s talk about something that lives rent-free in rival fans’ heads:😂😂</H3>
            <P><i>Manchester United’s historic numbers against the <b>“Big Six”</b> don’t just speak – <b>they SCREAM legacy.</b></i></P>
            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                Look, I get it. Rivals love dunking on our recent rollercoaster seasons. But before they pop Muratina 
                over a few bumps in our road, let’s remember: si ndo tulijenga io highway Mnaendeshea.<br/>

                Let me walk you through this nikaa tuko kwa local;
                 </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b>First off – those head-to-head stats? </b>They’re not spreadsheets.
                 They’re time capsules. While City were yo-yoing between divisions and Chelsea’s
                  biggest flex was a 1997 Cup Winners’ Cup, we were out here defining what “big game mentality” even means.

                Our goal count against the big guns? Not just good – historic. We’ve been putting 3
                 past liverpool since Fergie’s coat was still brown. And Arsenal recent glow-up? Cute.👏
                  But where were those 20 years of “next year’s our year” while we were busy collecting trebles?😂😂</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
               <b> Speaking of London clubs…</b><br/>
            To Chelsea fans waving Abramovich’s cash: respect the grind. But even your money couldn’t erase the DNA we’d
            already baked into this rivalry. Pre-Roman? We owned it. Post-Roman? Still ours more often than not.</p>

        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">       <b>And Spurs… oh, Spurs.</b><br/>
            “Spursy” isn’t a vibe – it’s a lifestyle. Meanwhile, our record against them isn’t a rivalry; it’s a receipt.
             They want to joke about our form? Let’s see their trophy cabinet after a Netflix documentary.
        </p>
        
        <p style="text-indent: 30px;"><b> Here’s the kicker</b><br/>Where were all these clubs when we were
             stacking up these numbers? City dreaming of oil money, Arsenal polishing an undefeated season like
              it’s the only dish in their cupboard, Chelsea playing financial roulette. We were too busy winning.

                        <br/>Does today’s form sting? Sure. But rebuilds take time. Meanwhile, these stats? They’re
                         Everest. Every rival’s still gasping for air halfway up the base camp.</p>

                <p>So yeah, laugh at our transfer windows. Meme about Glazers. But deep down? They
                   know matching this kind of legacy isn’t about money or TikTok hype. It’s about
                    something thicker than blood: decades of knowing how to win when it matters.</p>
      
      <p><b>TL;DR:</b>
            Form fades. Stats gather dust. But what we built? That’s forever.<br/>

            <i>We’re the standard. Always have been. Always will be. </i>🔴⚪️⚫️ <br/>
