                Life is weird. One minute you’re just trying to stay out of trouble, and the next, you’re thrown into a metaphorical
                 jungle where everyone wants to outshine, outsmart, or outright crush you. For me, this realization hit back in
                  primary school. I wasn’t the kid dreaming of gold medals or standing ovations—I just didn’t want to be one of the
                   “dumb ones at the back.” My pride wouldn’t let me.

                Thankfully, I had a knack for understanding things quickly, which helped me survive without too much effort.
                 But then high school came along, and surviving wasn’t enough. Suddenly, everything was a competition: who could
                  get the best grades, who got first dibs on school utilities, and who ruled the dorm hierarchies.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                I wasn’t exactly the biggest or strongest guy, so physical dominance was out of the question. My only option?
                 Outsmart everyone else. Spoiler alert: this didn’t always go as planned. I failed—a lot. But every failure
                  taught me something: how to think faster, plan better, and occasionally, when all else failed, look innocent enough to avoid punishment.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                I stumbled upon chess while scrolling through YouTube. I wasn’t really looking for it,
                 but there it was: a game that demanded strategy, patience, and an ability to think several steps ahead.
                  Naturally, I ignored it. I mean, who has time for a board game when you’re busy trying to survive high school?
            </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">    Fast forward to my first year at Meru, where I was studying Electrical Engineering.
             By then, I had started to understand the importance of standing alone. I joined the campus chess club almost on a whim,
              though I didn’t touch a chessboard for the first week. What finally caught my attention was a comment from someone in
               the group: “Chess reflects life.” That was all it took.

            I started researching how chess and life were connected, and before I knew it, I was hooked. The first time I played,
             I lost miserably. The second time, I lasted longer, but not by much. Then, something clicked. Piece by piece, I began
              to understand the game—not just how to play it, but how to think it.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">The day I beat the school’s best player three times in a row was legendary. Okay, fine, one of those wins might have
             been slightly influenced by liquid courage, but a win’s a win, right? After that, there was no turning back. Chess
              wasn’t just a game anymore; it was a way of thinking, a way of approaching life.<br/>

            I quickly fell in love with positional play. For those who don’t know, positional play is less about flashy moves
             and more about controlling the game’s flow. It’s about planning ahead, being patient, and understanding that
              sometimes the best move is no move at all. It became my favorite strategy—not just on the board, but in life.
        </p>    
        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Whenever I synced my chess strategy with real-life situations, things just made sense. I stopped rushing into
             decisions and started thinking about the bigger picture. Life challenges felt less overwhelming when I treated
              them like puzzles to solve. Chess taught me that sacrifices are necessary for greater gains, that waiting for
               the right opportunity is often better than forcing an outcome, and that even in the darkest moments, there’s
                always a way out if you look hard enough.<br/>

            These days, I’m on a mission to defeat all my friends at chess—purely for fun, of course (and maybe a little bit of
             bragging rights). But beyond the friendly competition, chess has given me something far more valuable: perspective.

        </p>  
           <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
            Life is chess. Every move matters, and even when you feel like you’ve lost, the game isn’t over until it’s over.
             So, take your time, think your moves through, and remember: you’re always just one step away from turning the tide.
